* Searches for proxies in open sources
* Intelligently stores state on disk across restarts
* Validates via configurable speed thresholds and anonymity
* Multiplexes HTTP/HTTPS MITM to HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5
* Exposes REST API for refresh stats and pool health
* Exposes minimal Query Language for filtering of History and Proxy Stats.
* Records request history in-memory for further UI inspection
* Real-time statistics display about available pool
* Packaged as a single executable binary, that also includes Web UI

# Usage

Download service, start it up, wait couple of minutes for the pool to pick up. Now run `curl -D - -x http://127.0.0.1:8090 -k http://httpbin.org/get` couple of times and see different origins and user agent headers.

# Concepts

* *Source* is an async process that looks at one or more pages for refreshed proxy list. 
* *Refresher* component does best effort on *scheduling* items. 
* Some *sources* perform better forwarded through a *Pool*, warming it up.
* One *proxy* may be seen in multiple *sources*, so we keep *exclusive* proxies per source across refreshes, which are not found in other sources.
* *Proxy* consists of protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, or SOCKS5) and IP:PORT.
* *Proxy* becomes *Scheduled* immediately after it's seen in the source.
* *Scheduled* could transition into *Probing* queue if it's not *Ignored* (e.g. *Timeouts* or *Blacklist*).
* *Probing* uses configurable pool of rotating anonymity *checkers* to check for liveliness.
* *Timeout* items are re-added to *Scheduled* queue as *Reverify* source to probe item up to 5 times.
* *Blacklist* hosts historical faulty proxies that should never be probed again.
* Successful *check* results in *Found* queue and gets added to a *Pool*.
* *Pool* subdivides its memory into *shards* for randomized rotation and minimal resource contention.
* *Pool* uses configurable and backpressure-controlled workers to perform HTTP request forwarding.
* Every *forwarded request* gets a serial number (returned in `X-Proxy-Serial` header) and picks a different *shard* for an *attempt*, which is reflected in response in `X-Proxy-Attempt` header.
* Every *forwarded request* can later be inspected through `GET /api/history` or UI.
* Every *attempt* picks first available working random proxy from a *shard* and marks it as *Offered*. Total number of offers per used proxy is returned in response in `X-Proxy-Offered` header.
* In the event of no working proxies in a *shard*, *proxy pool exhaustion* errors can do backpressure and slow down issuing of *serial* numbers through simple leaky bucket algorithm.
* Every *succeeded attempt* through a proxy increases it's *Success Rate* (*Succeeded*/*Offered*), which is also calculated per hour. Total number of succeded attempts of used proxy are returned via `X-Proxy-Succeed` header. Proxy used is returned in `X-Proxy-Through` header.
* Every *failed attempt* marks proxy as not working and *suspends offering* it for 5 minutes.

# User Interface

## Overview

![overview](docs/overview.png)

[http://localhost:8089/](http://localhost:8089/) shows current source refresh status and stats.

## Proxies

![proxies](docs/proxies.png)

[http://localhost:8089/proxies](http://localhost:8089/proxies) provides search interface over active pool of found proxies. By default, entries are sorted by last working on top. Query samples:

* [`Proxy ~ socks`](http://localhost:8089/proxies?filter=Proxy+%7E+socks) - all SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies
* [`Proxy ~ http`](http://localhost:8089/proxies?filter=Proxy+%7E+http) - all HTTP and HTTPS proxies
* [`Proxy ~ socks AND Succeed > 0`](http://localhost:8089/proxies?filter=Proxy+%7E+socks+AND+Succeed+%3E+0) - all SOCKS proxies that have ever succeeded
* [`Proxy ~ socks AND Succeed > 0 ORDER BY Offered DESC`](http://localhost:8089/proxies?filter=Proxy+%7E+socks+AND+Succeed+%3E+0+ORDER+BY+Offered+DESC) - all SOCKS proxies that have ever succeeded ordered by the number of times attempted
* [`Country:DE OR Country:UK`](http://localhost:8089/proxies?filter=Country%3ADE+OR+Country%3AUK) - proxies from Germany or the United Kingdom

## History

![history](docs/history.png)

[http://localhost:8089/history](http://localhost:8089/history) provides search interface over the last 1000 forwarding attempts (configurable). Sample queries:

* [`URL ~ "proxynova.com" AND StatusCode < 400`](http://localhost:8089/history?filter=URL+%7E+%22proxynova.com%22+AND+StatusCode+%3C+400) - all non-failed attempts to URL containing `proxynova.com`.

## Reverify

[http://localhost:8089/reverify](http://localhost:8089/reverify) provides search interface over timed out probes. Sample queries:

* [`Country:CN`](http://localhost:8089/reverify?filter=Country:CN) - all timed out proxies from China

## Blacklist

[http://localhost:8089/blacklist](http://localhost:8089/blacklist) provides search interface over unsuccessful probes. Sample queries:

* [`Failure ~ "this IP address found"`](http://localhost:8089/blacklist?filter=Failure%20~%20%22this%20IP%20address%20found%22) - all transparent proxies.

# Configuration

Conf file is looked in the following paths:

1. `$PWD/slrp.yml`
2. `$PWD/config.yml`
3. `$HOME/.slrp/config.yml`

Default configuration is approximately the following:

```yaml
app:
  state: $HOME/.slrp/data
  sync: 1m
log:
  level: info
  format: pretty
server:
  addr: "localhost:8089"
  read_timeout: 15s
mitm:
  addr: "localhost:8090"
  read_timeout: 15s
  idle_timeout: 15s
  write_timeout: 15s
pprof:
  enable: false
  addr: "localhost:6060"
checker:
  timeout: 5s
  strategy: simple
history:
  limit: 1000
```

Every configuration property can be overridden through environment variable by using `SLRP_` prefix followed by section name and key, divided by `_`. For example, in order to set log level to trace, do `SLRP_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE slrp`.

## app

Fabric that holds application components together.

* `state` - where data persists on disk through restarts of the application. Default is `.slrp/data` of your home directory.
* `sync` - how often data is synchronised to disk, pending availability of any updates of component state. Default is every minute.

## log

Structured logging meta-components.

* `level` - log level of application. Default is `info`. Possible values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.
* `format` - format of log lines printed. Default is `pretty`, though it's recommended for exploratory use only for performance reasons. Possible values are `pretty`, `json`, and `file` _(experimental)_. `file` will create a `$PWD/slrp.log`, unless specified by `log.file` property.
* `file` _(experimental)_ - application logs in JSON format. Default value is `$PWD/slrp.log`.

## server

API and UI serving component.

* `addr` - address of listening HTTP server. Default is [http://127.0.0.1:8089](http://127.0.0.1:8089).
* `read_timeout` - default is `15s`.
* `enable_profiler` - either or not enabling profiler endpoints. Default is `false`. Developer use only.

## mitm

HTTP proxy frontend.

* `addr` - address of listening HTTP proxy server. Default is [http://127.0.0.1:8090](http://127.0.0.1:8090).
* `read_timeout` - default is `15s`.
* `idle_timeout` - default is `15s`.
* `write_timeout` - default is `15s`.

## checker

Component for verification of proxy liveliness and anonymity.

* `timeout` - time to wait while performing verificatin. Default is `5s`.
* `strategy` - verification strategy to check the IP of the proxy. Default is `simple`, which will randomly select one of publicly available sites: [ifconfig.me](https://ifconfig.me), [ifconfig.io](https://ifconfig.io), [myexternalip.com](https://myexternalip.com), [ipv4.icanhazip.com/](https://ipv4.icanhazip.com/), [https://ipinfo.io/](ipinfo.io/), [api.ipify.org/](https://api.ipify.org/), or [wtfismyip.com](https://wtfismyip.com). Another strategy is `headers`, which will look for the real IP address in [https://ifconfig.me/all](https://ifconfig.me/all) or [https://ifconfig.io/all.json](https://ifconfig.io/all.json), which might have been added in HTTP headers while forwarding. And there's `twopass` strategy, that will first perform `simple` check and `headers` afterwards.

## history

Component for recording forwarded requests through a pool of proxies.

* `limit` - number of requests to keep in memory. Default is `1000`.

## ipinfo

You can optionally enable this feature. This product includes GeoLite2 Data created by MaxMind, available from https://www.maxmind.com. 

* `license` - your (free) license key for MaxMind downloads. You can skip specifying license key if `mmdb_asn` and `mmdb_city` are already downloaded in any other way and configured.
* `mmdb_asn` - already (or automatically) downloaded snapshots of MaxMind database. Default is `$HOME/.slrp/maxmind/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb`
* `mmdb_city` - already (or automatically) downloaded snapshots of MaxMind database. Default is `$HOME/.slrp/maxmind/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`
